My Greatest Challenge - Team Up


I believe my greatest challenges segment of my experience during bootcamp will be, Team Up. 
In the past, especially during my time in college I encountered many situations where group 
assignments and task were assigned. During more than one occasion I recall having to bare the 
brunt of the tasks because others were either unwilling or too busy to cooperate in the task assigned 
to us. I recall more than one instance where I ended up doing the majority of the work in order 
to obtain a good grade, benefitting the whole. Although this did not take place all the time, Iâ€™ve come 
to believe that there are those who seek to benefit from the labor of others.
